h2. Storing your data in the Cloud

I wanted to be able to deploy the EurekaJ Manager application in a cloud environment, while still being able to quickly scale the application out 
when the time needed. EurekaJ Manager currently only stores its data using an embedded key-value database where the data is stored on the local file
system (Berekely DB JE). Now, I still wanted to be able to deploy and run EurekaJ Manager in this mode for installations where EurekaJ Manager 
needs to be located on the local internal network. In addition I also wanted a "Cloud mode" where EurekaJ could store its data in a key-value database 
that lived in the Cloud. 

For this to work I needed to abstract away the data-access layer in EurekaJ Manager and I decided to allow third party plugins to be able to extend
where and how EurekaJ Manager would persist its data. I would then supply EurekaJ Manager with two .Jar files (One of Berekely DB JE, and one for the
Cloud storage), and letting the user specify which data-storage they wanted based on a configuration setting. 

h1. SimpleDB The Cloud-ready key-value database from Amazon AWS

Amazon has recently added SimpleDB to its line of services offered as part of the AWS (Amazon WebService) offering. SimpleDB is a key-value store 
and as such, was very compatible with what I wanted to achieve with the data-access extension to EurekaJ.
