<h2>EurekaJ Profiler</h2>

<p>EurekaJ is an Open Source, Standards based profiler tool for Java applications. This site is intended to include all documentations and information regarding the project, its use and its benefits. The EurekaJ project has a long list of features, more of which will be revealed closer to the release date. EurekaJ is currently in early development. A plan for a first release is under development.</p>

<p>As the project started, work on a custom Javaagent was planned and started using Javassist as the bytecode library of choice. I have later started looking at BTrace and I am currently looking into writing an agent based upon BTrace, as BTrace has a large feature set that goes hand in hand with features planned for EurekaJ. Basing the agent on BTrace, I will be able to focus my attention upon the EurekaJ Manager, meaning that the feature set of the Manager application will be completed earlier.</p>
